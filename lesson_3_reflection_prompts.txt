When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want other people to see my changes, working on a team, backup for my files and commits

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that there are no merge conflicts

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks if I was on the Github website and the user does not approve of my changes and I wanna edit it myself. Clones if I want to start a new one on my local repository. Branches if im making a new feature.
