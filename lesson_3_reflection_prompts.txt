When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want other people to see my changes, working on a team, backup for my files and commits

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that there are no merge conflicts

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks if I was on the Github website and the user does not approve of my changes and I wanna edit it myself. Clones if I want to start a new one on my local repository. Branches if im making a new feature. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can totally view the changes from your local current copy and DIFF the differences between them bro. So yah thats cool and shit. You can merge on your own without creating a conflict. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Idk...
